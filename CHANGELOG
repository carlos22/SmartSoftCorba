==========================================================================

16Jul2003	components/smartLaserReplayServer	Boris Kluge <kluge@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	Added a component which replays laser scans from XML files, for example 
	scans which have been recorded previously by the smartDataLoggingClient.
	In principle it should be easy to extend this concept to other data types,
	but since there is no common way of accessing the time stamp of a record,
	timing the pushes on replay cannot be done in a generic way.

==========================================================================

10Jun2003	components/smartSpeechOutputServer	Boris Kluge <kluge@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	Added a text2speech component "smartSpeechOutputServer".
	This component does not provide text2speech capabilities on its
	own, but acts as an adapter to text2speech packages like "mbrola". 
	It can be even configured in a way such that no speech is output but 
	the text goes for example to a logfile.
	See smartSpeechOutputServer.dox for details on the component and mbrola.dox
	for details on how to set up mbrola for the german language (which is not
	straightforward!).

==========================================================================

05/27/03	smartSoftKernel/smartSoft	Christian Schlegel
						schlegel@faw.uni-ulm.de

	Removed the "SendServer<C>" argument in the call of "handleSend()"
	of the SendServerHandler. The reason is that the handleSend() does
  	not need to call the SendServer as is the case with the Query for
	example where one has to provide the answer.

	Look at the handleSend() member function of all derived classes of 
	the SendServerHandler class and remove the first argument there.
   	The "SmartQtSendServerHandler" and the "ThreadQueueSendHandler"
	do not provide anymore the server reference which received the
	command.
