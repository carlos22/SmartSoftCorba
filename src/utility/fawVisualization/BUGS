o There is almost no documentation besides some doxygen comments in the
  headers and the two example applications fawVisualizationTest and
  fawVisualizationClient. Anyone willing to write some? :)

o It relies on the presence of the SmartSoft directory and Makefile
  structure for building. This is an obstacle to its usage in other 
  contexts.

o Some parts like the scene graph structure are very incomplete so that
  their presence might be confusing.
