This directory provides some iostream, streambuf, and buffer classes.
All of the methods are inlined, i.e. all you have to link against is 
libz if you want to use compression. 
Since the implementation of the iostreams differs notably between 
gcc-2.95.2 and gcc-3.2, there are alternative implementations, which
are marked by the infix "gcc2" for the vintage version.

Comments on each file follow below.

------------------
FILES:
fawDeflatingOutputStream.gcc2.hh
fawDeflatingOutputStream.hh
fawDeflatingOutputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawDeflatingOutputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
Wrapper for ostream/streambuf. Data written to a DeflatingOutputStream
is compressed and written to the associated ostream/streambuf.

TESTS:
fawDeflate.cc
  If a filename FN is given on the command line, FN is deflated to FN.deflated,
  otherwise stdin is deflated to stdout.

------------------
FILES:
fawInflatingInputStream.gcc2.hh
fawInflatingInputStream.hh
fawInflatingInputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawInflatingInputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
Wrapper for istream/streambuf. Data available from the associated istream/
streambuf is assumed to be compressed and is inflated on reading.

TESTS:
fawInflate.cc
  Complement to fawDeflate.
  If a filename FN is given on the command line, FN is inflated to FN.inflated,
  otherwise stdin is inflated to stdout.
fawStreamCompressionTest.cc
  If a command line argument "level" is given, deflates stdin with compression 
  level "level" stdout. Otherwise, stdin is deflated to stdout.

------------------
FILES:
fawDynamicBuffer.gcc2.hh
fawDynamicBuffer.hh

COMMENT:
A dynamic buffer for long strings. Chunks of memory (several 100 bytes) are 
allocated dynamically to hold the data. Appending is supported, deleting is
unsupported.

------------------
FILES:
fawMemoryStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawMemoryStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
A streambuf that collaborates with the dynamic buffer above. A simple application
example is compressing output in memory: create a dynamic buffer "buf", create a
memory streambuf "sb" associated with "buf", create a deflating output streambuf
"dos" connected to "sb", and write data to "dos". After closing "dos", the compressed
data can be read from "buf".

------------------
FILES:
fawBufferInputStream.gcc2.hh
fawBufferInputStream.hh
fawBufferInputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawBufferInputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
Associate a streambuf/istream with any begin/end-pair of input-iterators.

------------------
FILES:
fawBufferOutputStream.gcc2.hh
fawBufferOutputStream.hh
fawBufferOutputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawBufferOutputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
Associate a streambuf/ostream with a begin/end-pair of output-iterators.
Writing to the stream may fail if the buffer is full, i.e. the current
iterator equals the end-iterator.

TEST:
fawBufferStreamsTest.cc
  Create a buffer (vector<char>) in memory, associate streams to it, write to and 
  read from the streams.

------------------
FILES:
fawFileDesInputStream.gcc2.hh
fawFileDesInputStream.hh
fawFileDesInputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawFileDesInputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
gcc-2.95.2 provides an ifstream ctor which accepts a file descriptors as argument. Since 
the more STL-conforming gcc-3.2 does not provide such a ctor any more, I wrote an own class 
for this purpose.

------------------
FILES:
fawFileDesOutputStream.gcc2.hh
fawFileDesOutputStream.hh
fawFileDesOutputStreamBuf.gcc2.hh
fawFileDesOutputStreamBuf.hh

COMMENT:
See comment on fawFileDesInputStream above.

TEST:
fawFileDesStreamsTest.cc
  Send a file (given by its name on the command line) to /dev/null using
  FileDesStreams. Not really usefull.

------------------
FILE:
fawFileCompare.cc

COMMENT:
Used for debugging. Simply ignore it, or read the source code for more information.

------------------
FILE:
fawStreamsTest.cc

COMMENT:
Stream data from stdin through a DeflatingOutputStream into a DynamicBuffer.
Then, stream data from the buffer through a InflatingInputStream to stdout.
Reports character counts (compression ratio).

------------------
FILE:
fawMemoryStreamBufTest.cc

COMMENT:
Same as fawStreamsTest, without the deflating/inflating steps.
