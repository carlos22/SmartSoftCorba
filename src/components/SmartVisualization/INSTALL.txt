This component requires MRPT 0.9.3 which is different from the version all
other components use. 0.9.3 is thus installed in utility:

download  mrpt-0.9.3.tar.gz

$ cd $SMART_ROOT/src/utility/
$ tar xzf mrpt-0.9.3.tar.gz 
$ cd mrpt-0.9.3/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

configure mrpt with ccmake to be installed in /home/smartsoft/SOFTWARE/smartsoft/src/utility/mrpt-0.9.3/install
execute as user(!):

$ make 
$ make install

Adjust the ld library path in order to execute it:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/smartsoft/SOFTWARE/smartsoft/src/utility/mrpt-0.9.3/install/lib/
