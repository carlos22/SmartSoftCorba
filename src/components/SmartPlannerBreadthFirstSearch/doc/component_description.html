		The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch provides path planning services
		based on grid maps. It uses a grid map from a map building component
		(e.g. SmartMapperGridMap) and sends an intermediate waypoint as well as
		the goalpoint to the motion execution (e.g. SmartCdlServer).
		
		<p>A wave propagation algorithm starting from goal cells backward to the
		current position of the robot is used to calculate a path. The path
		planning is further enhanced by a path shortening heuristic: the path
		is followed starting at the current robot position until a straight
		line from the robot position to the cell in question on the path
		interferes with an obstacle. The prior cell is then sent as an
		intermediate waypoint. The geometric path planning is applied
		continuously every one second.
		
		<p>Several goal circles and/or goal lines can be specified as goals in
		the planner. The planner will generate a path to the goal with the shortest
		distance.

		<p>The SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch for example can be used with SmartCdlServer
		which cannot handle local minimas. Goals are then specified in the
		SmartPlannerBreadthFirstSearch. A CDL_GOAL_REACHED event is fired by the CDL
		component as soon as the final goal is reached.

				The event state PLANNER_UNKNOWN can be used for activation if
				the current state is unknown. Events are sent on every change.

				<p>The port will send the events listed below:

				<ul>
					<li>PLANNER_NO_PATH: 
						Fired if no path could be found for at least five
						seconds. Invalid goals (invalid flag=true) are pushed
						via plannerUpdateNewestServer when no path was found.

					<li>PLANNER_NO_ERROR:
						No errors in planner, valid goals (invalid flag=false)
						are pushed via plannerUpdateNewestServer.

					<li>PLANNER_UNKNOWN_ERROR:
		  				An unknown error occurred.

					<li>PLANNER_NO_GOAL_AVAILABLE:
			 			No goals available.

					<li>PLANNER_GOAL_NOT_MARKED:
						Every goal cell is already occupied. The goal cells
						could not be marked.

					<li>PLANNER_START_OCCUPIED_OBSTACLE:
						The start cell (current robot position) is occupied by
						an obstacle.

					<li>PLANNER_START_OCCUPIED_GOAL:
						The robot is standing on the goal cell.

					<li>PLANNER_WRONG_MAPID:
						The latest grid map is of another id than the current
						planner id.  The planner will not plan anything and
						will not send intermediate waypoints and goal points.
