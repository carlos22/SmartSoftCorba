		This component is based on the OpenRAVE framework. It allows to plan a
		trajectory to a given point with the specified manipulator. The path
		planning performs collision free manipulation by taking, for example,
		obstacles in the scene into account.
		The scene can be loaded from a XML file or via an
		object recognition. Furthermore it is possible to plan higher level
		tasks like grasping an object and putting it on a table.
		All coordinates are on the robot coordinate system.

<table class="rowsep">
<tr>
	 	<td><i>neutral:</i>
 		<td>The component does not perform any planning or IK calculation. It accepts parameters.<tr>
	 	<td><i>trajectory:</i>
 		<td>The component can plan paths or plan higher level tasks like grasping an object and place it somewhere.<tr>
	 	<td><i>demonstration:</i>
 		<td>The component just synchronizes the modeled manipulator with the real manipulator. This state is mainly for testing purpose.<tr>
	 	<td><i>simulation:</i>
 		<td>The component does not send any trajectory to the real manipulator. It computes all IK solutions and plans path as in ''trajectory'' state.</table>





<h2>Parameters</h2>

<table class="rowsep">
<tr>
	 	<td><i>ENV_CLEAR:</i>
 		<td>The scene is reset to its default as loaded initially from the ini-configuration.<tr>
	 	<td><i>ENV_LOAD_OBJECTRECOGNITION(?envid):</i>
 		<td>The environment with id ?envid is loaded from the object recognition. The environmentQueryClient is used to get the environment from the object recognition.<tr>
	 	<td><i>ENV_SAVE_FILE(?fileid):</i>
 		<td>Saves the complete environment to a file. The filename can be specified in the ini-file. The ?fileid specifies the concrete file.<tr>
	 	<td><i>ENV_LOAD_FILE(?fileid):</i>
 		<td>The environment is loaded from a file. The filename can be specified in the ini-file. The ?fileid specifies the concrete file.<tr>
	 	<td><i>OPENRAVE_GRASPOBJ(?objid):</i>
 		<td>The specified object with id ?objid is grasped in OpenRAVE. This parameter is necessary for linking the object to the manipulator. After this operation the grasped object is part of the manipulator and is therefore considered in the path planning process. There will be no calculation how the object is grasped, the object will be just linked to the manipulator. If the object is not between the gripper the object will also be linked to the manipulator even if the object is not grasped in real. So be aware when to set this parameter.<tr>
	 	<td><i>OPENRAVE_RELEASEOBJ(?objid):</i>
 		<td>The specified object with id ?objid is released in OpenRAVE and is no longer part of the manipulator. See GRASPOBJ for more information.<tr>
	 	<td><i>OBJ_COMPUTEGRASPTABLE(?objid):</i>
 		<td>Computes the grasp tables to a given object with id ?objid. The grasp tables are necessary for the higher tasks. The grasp tables will be computed only once for one type of object, for example a cup will only have one grasp table as long as it has the same dimensions. Furthermore the computation needs a couple of minutes and should always be done separately, for example when new objects are learned.<tr>
	 	<td><i>OBJ_ADD(?objid)(?type):</i>
 		<td>An object from ?type with ?objid is added to the current environment. The object type has to be known by the OpenRave component. The object is added into the origin (0,0,0).<tr>
	 	<td><i>OBJ_DELETE(?objid):</i>
 		<td>Deletes the object with id ?objid out of the current environment.<tr>
	 	<td><i>OBJ_MOVE(?objid)(?x)(?y)(?z):</i>
 		<td>Moves the object with ?objid to the specified (absolute) coords [m] in robot coordinates.<tr>
	 	<td><i>GRASPING_NONE:</i>
 		<td>Only the trajectory to the specific point is planned upon the next path planning send request to pathPlanningSendServer<tr>
	 	<td><i>GRASPING_SIMPLE(?lowerHeight)(?upperHeight)(?lowerDepth)(?upperDepth)(?lowerAngle)(?upperAngle)(?lowerRoll)(?upperRoll):</i>
 		<td>When this is set, a simple iterative grasping method is applied to compoute a grasping pose to the given grasping position. The pose will be iterated through the given boundaries. Iteration starts at the lower bound and proceeds to the upper bound. Direction can be changed by giving the upper bound a lower value than the lower bound. Height, depth in meter. Angles in degree.<tr>
	 	<td><i>GRASPING_ADVANCED:</i>
 		<td>Not implemented.<tr>
	 	<td><i>SIMULATION_TEST_IK_ONLY:</i>
 		<td>When set, the component only tests whether an IK solution can be found and fires PATH_FOUND if found. No path calculation and manipulation will be done. Works only in ''simulation'' state.<tr>
	 	<td><i>SIMULATION_PLAN_ALL:</i>
 		<td>IK solution and path will be calculated.<tr>
	 	<td><i>PARALLELIZATION_ON:</i>
 		<td>Turns parallelization mode on. The virtual openRave manipulator is only synchronized once before the next trajectory. For all further trajectories, the openRave manipulator will not be synchronized with the real one.<tr>
	 	<td><i>PARALLELIZATION_OFF:</i>
 		<td>Turns parallelization mode off. The virtual openRave manipulator will be synchronized before every trajectory planning.</table>

				Only the first tool center point or joint angle configuration in the communication object is used. For this tool center point or joint angle configuration a path planning is performed. The handler fires events when it begins to plan a trajectory ('PLANNING_PATH') or when a trajectory has been found ('PATH_FOUND') or when no trajectory can be calculated ('NO_PATH_FOUND' if the planning is unsuccessful or 'NO_IKSOLUTION_FOUND' if the inverse kinematic cannot be calculated). The environment has to be loaded before this handler is called over the parameter port. The tool center point in the trajectory must be given in the robot coordinate system.

				<ul>
					<li>PLANNING_PATH: Fired when component started planning

						and a trajectory has been found.

					<li>NO_PATH_FOUND: Fired when no trajectory can be found
						to the specified position.

					<li>NO_IKSOLUTION_FOUND: Fired when the inverse kinematic caluclation fails.
