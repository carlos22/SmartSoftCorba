Besides the SmartSoft kernel, this folder contains core example components
(directories starting with smartExampleComponent) and the required
communication objects (directories starting with smartExample).

These examples are not created using the SmartSoft MDSD toolchain. Use them for
testing the SmartSoft kernel and as examples on how to write components and
communication objects without the MDSD approach.
