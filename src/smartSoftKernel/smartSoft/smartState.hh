  /** Client part of state pattern (master).
   *
   *  The configuration class provides priorized mutexes for protecting
   *  configurations. Normally, a complex robotic system requires a lot of
   *  different components which can not all run at the same time. Depending
   *  on the current task to be executed and depending on the available
   *  ressources, one has to be able to activate and deactivate components
   *  and activities within components. One the one hand deactivation should
   *  be done in such a way that the component can perform cleanup tasks.
   *  On the other hand a component must still be interruptable even if it
   *  is pending in a blocking call because the corresponding server has
   *  already been deactivated.
   *
   *  The configuration class therefore provides mechanisms for graceful
   *  activation and deactivation of sets of activities within components.
   *
   *  As is explained in the specification of the state pattern, one can
   *  activate one mainstate at a time. A mainstate can however comprise
   *  several substates which are all active at the same time. A master
   *  can only set mainstates whereas the slave can only acquire substates.
   *  This allows the simple management of sets of concurrent activities.
   *
   *  For a complete description see the printed documentation and further
   *  details in @ref example3.
