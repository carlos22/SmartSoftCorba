   *  themself as ports. Dynamic wiring allows context dependent configuration
   *  of data flow between components as is often needed at the skill level of
   *  robotic architectures. The master part of the wiring pattern is visible
   *  to the user and allows to specify to which service of a server component
   *  a specific port of a component should connect to. Connections can be
   *  changed at any time since all communication patterns provide status
   *  information to cope with modified connections.
